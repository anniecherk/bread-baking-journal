# Takeaways

- silicon spatula makes a great bowl scraper
- make sure to really flour the banneton well :(


## Mixing the Poolish

Started at 7:30 pm Wednesday

- 250 g bread flour
- 250 g water at 78 F
- .2 or ??? g yeast

## Mixing the Dough

Checked it at 7:30 am- the Poolish is supposed to be ready 12-14 hours post mixing, but again I think it had already peaked.

Mixed:
- poolish
- 125 g water at 100 F : trying slightly cooler water b/c its summer
- 1 + .3 maybe g yeast? : trying low altitude adjustment of under-shooting 1.5 grams
- 10.5ish grams salt
- 250 g bread flour

Mixed by pincering until it was a lot more well mixed than last time- I made sure there weren't any dry patches this time, but the dough still had some "lumps". I don't think I can do anything about that though and the bread turned out fine last time so perhaps it's okay. Maybe that turns into a slightly denser area of the loaf?

## Folds

Fold 1 @ 8:20

Fold 2 @ 8:50 - I was aiming for 8:40 and got sidetracked

Fold 3 @ 9:10

## Shaping

Checked in at 10:30 am, decided to not shape until about 11am

Shaped up nicely

## Proofing

Proofed for a full hour

## Baking

The dough got stuck to the basket :(

I got it out but it doesn't have that nice design

I tried a rolling pin to get that bump in the top but it's definitely too wide

Baking 30 minutes lid on, 20 minutes lid off at 485 F
