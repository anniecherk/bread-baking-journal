# Take aways

- Next time, try shorter ferment times...

## Mixing the Poolish

Mixed it at 8pm, planning to check on it around 7 or 8 tomorrow morning.

Mixed: 
- 250 g King Arthur's bread flour
- 250 g water at 80 F
- .2 g maybe of yeast

## Mixing the dough

Mixed the dough at 8:15 am, the poolish was again probably a bit past ripe?

It was a real pain to get all the flour incorporated... there must be a better way!

- 250 g normal white flour
- 120 g water at 99 F
- 10ish g salt
- 1.5 g yeast

Folded 3 times, ending around 9:15am

## Shaping & Proofing
I let the dough sit for 2 hours and change; it shaped into a ball really nicely. Nice elastic dough.

I've started keeping a water container nearby so that if when I shape it doesn't stick to itself (because it's floured side on floured side) I can just put a little water on to make it sticky and I think that's been helping a lot.

Preheated the oven for 45 minutes.

## Baking

Baked at 475 for 30 minutes with the lid on, and maybe 18 minutes or so with the lid off. 

Had a really nice crumb but was pretty dense... I think it could have used another 10 minutes or so in the oven but I was impatient, and I should troubleshoot why it was dense. Maybe consider high altitude adjustment, maybe a shorter bulk ferment period.
